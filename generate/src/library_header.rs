//! ## Introduction  
//! 3511 emojis and 4580 emoji variants with localization data in 143 languages  
//! This crate contains a huge amount of data about every emoji ever.
//! Some of the data includes:
//! - Name
//! - Glyph
//! - Unicode Release Version
//! - Classification
//! - Variants
//! - Annotations in many languages
//!
//! This crate also provides functions for searching through emojis by
//! [name](lookup_by_name/index.html) and [glyph](lookup_by_glyph/index.html),
//! as well as several [fuzzy search](search/index.html) functions.
//! ## Quickstart  
//! ```rust
//! fn main() {
//!    println!("{}", emoji::food_and_drink::food_marine::CRAB.glyph);
//! }
//! ```
//! See more examples [here](https://github.com/Shizcow/emoji-rs/tree/master/examples/).
//! ## Languages  
//! By default, only English annotations are compiled in.
//! To enable other languages, use the feature corresponding to that languge. An exhaustive
//! list of supported languages can be found
//! [here](https://github.com/Shizcow/emoji-rs/blob/master/emoji/Cargo.toml).
